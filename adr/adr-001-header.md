# ADR 001: Configuration File Headers

## Context
You would like uniform headers in your configuration files so that you can quickly get to the original project and any documentation.

Credit to [Josh Medeski](https://github.com/joshmedeski) (Sesh creator) for the idea when examining his config files.

## Decision
Headers are formatted into four parts:
1. Title, formatted with the shadow unicode font through figlet.
2. The one line description of the project, usually from github.
3. Links to the projects github page and documentation page.
4. (optional) Any other commentary or defaults you think are important to mention.

## Status
January 25, 2025: Accepted.
